# Third-party notices

Verified on 2026-11-04 against the headers of the files in `vendor/` and the license files shipped next to them.

No GPL, LGPL, AGPL, or CC BY-SA code or fonts are included. All icons in the interface are original SVG drawings made for this project (`js/ui/icons.js`); no third-party icon set, image, or font is used for the interface other than Heebo.

`docs/v3/vendor/vexflow.js` (VexFlow 4.2.5, MIT) is only a copy used for the design mockup in `docs/v3/`; it is not loaded by the application.

| Heebo | variable font, Google Fonts v28 (hebrew + latin subsets) | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/main/ofl/heebo/OFL.txt — copyright line matches `@fontsource/heebo@5.3.0` LICENSE |

Bravura is not shipped as a separate font file. VexFlow 4.2.3 embeds glyph outlines generated from `Bravura_1.392.otf`. The OFL still applies to those outlines. The VexFlow copy of the notice is dated 2019; the upstream tag `bravura-1.392` notice is dated 2015. Both are SIL OFL 1.1 with Reserved Font Name "Bravura". Both notices are reproduced below.

Heebo files in `assets/fonts/` were downloaded from `fonts.gstatic.com` (the files referenced by the official CSS for Heebo) and are covered by the Heebo OFL.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide

redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
